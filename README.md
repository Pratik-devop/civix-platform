> **Civix Platform (Frontend)** — a web-based interface empowering citizens to participate in local governance through petitions, voting, and public sentiment polling. Built using React 19 and React Router 7, this frontend focuses on seamless user experience, accessibility, and clean UI design.

---

## 🧭 Overview

Civix enables users to:
- Create and view community petitions  
- Participate in location-based polls and votes  
- Track officials' responses and public feedback  
- View dashboards summarizing civic activities  

This repository includes the **frontend** implementation only — backend APIs, authentication, and databases are separate and can be integrated later.

<!-- My Role/Ownership -->
This is the frontend implementation of the Civix project — developed independently as a personal project inspired by an earlier internship concept.
I rebuilt and redesigned the UI, optimized components, added responsive styling, and organized the structure for scalability and clarity.
